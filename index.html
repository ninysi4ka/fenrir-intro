<br>About</br>
<br>Hi everyone! Welcome to my page! My name is Nina. I am a stay
at home mom of 2 little kids. I am from Hillsboro, OR. I like to travel, to go
hiking, camping, spend good quality time with my family and friends. When I have
a free time I like to read books and watch Netflix (this is my own way to learn
English). </br>

<br>Experience </br>
<br>All my expirience in coding started from the day I dive
into coding bootcamp, so just one month. I am new in it. But I like to learn
something new all the time and I think soon there will be more to tell. All my
job expirience based on helping to build custom PCs, upgrade it. Also
installation of new hardware and software back in Ukraine. </br>
